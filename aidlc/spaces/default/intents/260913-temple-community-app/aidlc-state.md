## Project Information
- **Project**: Mobile app (Flutter, single codebase for iOS+Android) for our Digamber Jain temple community. Backend: AWS, using Amplify Gen2 (Cognito for auth with Google federation, Amplify Data/AppSync+DynamoDB, S3 storage, Lambda functions). Features: (1) Content feed of temple happenings - event dates/times, donation call-outs, visiting saints/dignitaries - posted by admins through a simple in-app admin UI; admin access is Google sign-in restricted to an allowlist of admin Google accounts (Cognito Google federation + allowlist-gated admin group). (2) Online donations via UPI (PhonePe/Google Pay), including recurring/subscription donations - needs a payment aggregator with UPI Autopay support (e.g. Razorpay), account to be set up. (3) A library of Jain religious PDFs (daily poojan, vidhaans, bhaktamar, meri bhavna, etc.), browsable by category. (4) A suggestion box where users submit suggestions visible only to admins, not to other users.
